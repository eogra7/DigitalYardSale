Instructions for running the application:
1. Download the DigitalYardSale.apk file to an Android phone (via USB or other)
2. Locate the file on the phone using File Explorer and install

The source code is included in ..\Project and Source Code\app\src\main\java\com\evanogra\mobileappdev2017\
The Android Studio project is also included but the IDE is difficult to set up as it has to be configured to the specific version of Android.

If there are any difficulties in running the application, please contact me at eogra99@gmail.com
